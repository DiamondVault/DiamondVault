## 📜 Smart Contract Verification
- ✅ Our contract is fully verified on **BscScan**.  
- [View Contract on BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x5e731816eE98487A667ed5051e773a19D48d1203#code)

ℹ️ Note: BscScan shows *"Similar Match Source Code"* because our contract is based on a standard **AntiBotStandardToken** template (using OpenZeppelin).  
This does **not** affect security or functionality — it simply means our code matches a widely used, audited base contract.
